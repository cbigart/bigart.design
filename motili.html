				<h4>Defining the Target Audience</h4>
				<p class="m-b-sm">Since Motili was working on repositioning themselves in the industry. We started the project by defining who they wanted their new identity to appeal to. They wanted to focus on property managers, contractors, and investors. The goal of the new homepage was to quickly provide information for all of these viewers. We provided the client with many different iterations of the homepage before we landed on the final version.</p>

				<h4>Applying the Brand</h4>
				<p class="m-b-sm">During the homepage process, we were also working with the Motili team on their new visual identity system. We worked on a new color palette, fonts, photography, and illustration style. These aspects were also implemented into the user interface of the website, digital platform and smartphone application.</p>

				<h4>Digital Platform</h4>
				<p>After the website was designed, the next task was to bring new life to the digital platform and design the appearance of their smartphone application. The goal of their platform is to allow contractors to be able to see incoming job requests, bid on them, order equipment, and follow steps to complete the job.</p>
				<p class="m-b-sm">During this process we worked Motili to create user flows, features, wireframes, and production assets. We also provided Motili with guidelines for the new look of their user digital interface. It defined where logos go, button states, and typography.</p>
