          <p>I believe that finding simple solutions to complex problems beings with goals, communication, and a sketch book.</p>
          <p>I am a generalist designer helping clients build their brands at Idea Kraft, a branding agency, based in Binghamton, NY. I enjoy focusing on web and mobile projects but my capabilities include branding, print, presentation, product design, and design consulting. A few clients I have worked with are: ACCO Brands, Cat<sup>&reg;</sup> Lights, Central National Gottsman, Cooperstown Brewing Co., Modern Marketing Concepts, and Motili.</p>
          <p>Even though I started my career strictly as a Graphic Designer, interests have lead me to focus on digital design and front end web development. I work with a wide variety of tools. This includes but isnâ€™t limited to the following: Adobe CC, CSS, Figma, Git, GitHub, Illustrator, HTML, Photoshop, and Sketch.</p>
