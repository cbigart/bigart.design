					<h1>Greater Binghamton Chamber of Commerce Website Redesign</h1>
					<div class="divider--small"></div>
          <p>The Greater Binghamton Chamber of Commerce has been a staple for business in the Southern Tier. They are a network of over 800 members that help provide businesses the resources and education that they need to grow.</p>

				<h4>User Research</h4>
				<p>Before we could design the new look and feel of the Chamber website, the team started designing a Typeform survey. This survey allowed us to ask potential, current, and past members what they use the Chamber website for and what they would like to see on it.</p>
				<p>Out of 240 visitors to the Typeform we received a total of 142 responses. This helped us define the type of users that were viewing the website the most and what they were coming for.</p>
				<p><em>Main Takeaways</em></p>
				<ul>
					<li>71&#37; of the responses were from Chamber members</li>
					<li>47&#37; of those responding represent small business</li>
					<li>Most important services are: networking, economic development, exposure, advocacy, community initiatives, and growing my business &#40;respectively&#41;</li>

				<h4>Applying the Brand</h4>
				<p class="m-b-sm">During the homepage process, we were also working with the Motili team on their new visual identity system. We worked on a new color palette, fonts, photography, and illustration style. These aspects were also implemented into the user interface of the website, digital platform and smartphone application.</p>

				<h4>Digital Platform</h4>
				<p>After the website was designed, the next task was to bring new life to the digital platform and design the appearance of their smartphone application. The goal of their platform is to allow contractors to be able to see incoming job requests, bid on them, order equipment, and follow steps to complete the job.</p>
				<p class="m-b-sm">During this process we worked Motili to create user flows, features, wireframes, and production assets. We also provided Motili with guidelines for the new look of their user digital interface. It defined where logos go, button states, and typography.</p>

				<h4>Custom Emails</h4>
				<p class="m-b-sm">After the new brand was in-place, it was time to spread the news to current and potential clients. We helped create multiple email templates and campaigns for Motili that were used to attract new customers.</p>
